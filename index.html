  <h2> This is one of my stories named Jail Breakin and Eatin Bacon. </h2>
	<p>The cold wind bit her face as she walked through the snow. The snow was falling so thickly she could barely see where she was going. She walked up to the gate and entered the password. She hoped she could remember the password, so that she could escape. She entered the cold, dark prison. She could feel the hopelessness that was radiating from the prisoners. She spotted a camera. She took her ink gun out, and shot the camera. She slipped past the corner and narrowly dodged two patrolling soldiers. She evaded the soldiers and cameras until she reached the cell. Near the cell, she saw a guard who was sleeping. She pulled a canister of heavy sleeping gas out of her bag. Once she knew the guard was not going to wake up, she stole the keys. She opened the cell, and saw the baby. She grabbed the baby, gave it some of the gas, and left. She heard two soldiers approaching, and she knew they would see the baby was missing. She unlocked another cell with kids and asked if they had any dolls that were babies. They said they did and asked if she could help them escape. She took the fake baby and placed into the cell. After the soldiers were gone, she got out of the cell and left. She saw an air vent and boosted the kids into it. She climbed into the vent with the baby and then crawled to where she could rest for a moment. The vent was big enough for her to fit in, with some space for the baby. She dropped out of the vent into a cell near a window. She took an ax out of her bag and broke the window. Alarms started going off as she and the kids escaped the prison. She took the baby, wrapped it in a blanket, and then carried it as she and the kids ran from the prison. Guards were pursuing them as they ran for the forest. She showed the kids her tree fort, as they all climbed in. She pulled up the rope ladder as the soldiers approached the fort. They called out to her saying that they would be safer not in a tree because they could cut it down. The guards pulled out a chainsaw and started cutting the trunk. She took some rope and made a series of handholds from the fort to thicker trees. As the kids left, she packed some provisions for the group. They didn’t need much, as the kids were already used to being fed almost nothing at the prison. Eventually the soldiers gave up trying to scare them and left three soldiers guarding the tree. She climbed back to the fort, which was highly unstable. She grabbed a bag that contained some bricks that she had stolen a while ago. She passed them to the kids, and saw their joy as they got to hit the people who had trapped them just a few hours ago. Once the guards were not going to be able to pursue them, they walked on through the forest. When it was dark, they made a tent of sticks and leaves. They took blankets and laid them on the dirt floor. She took her blanket and gave it to the kids. They needed warmth more than she did. She built a fire and eventually drifted into a light sleep. She woke up to a scream and a dozen thoughts rushed through her head. She ran to the tent, and asked, “What is wrong?” One of the kids had a spider on their head. She briskly plucked off the spider, then started out of the tent to make breakfast for everyone. The kids had bacon from the prison, so they ate bacon with canned peaches. 
As soon as they finished they set out for her friend’s house, where they could lie low and figure out what to do next. They had to trudge through the snow, which was hard for the smaller kids. She carried the smaller kids until they had to take a break. They heard a rustle in the woods. A couple minutes later some people jumped out. They told the kids and her that this was their territory. She responded with “We’ll leave as fast as we can.” Everyone began to walk again. Much later, one of the kids behind her let out a bloodcurdling scream. There was a trail of blood behind them, and one of the kids had tripped on a giant rock and hit their head. She used a makeshift gurney that was a blanket tied to long sticks. Everyone helped carry the child, which really made it easier for her. The baby suddenly started crying, and she realized that she had forgotten all about the baby. She took the baby out of the blanket and saw that it was too cold. It would not make it that much longer unless she did something. She zipped the baby up in her jacket with her and let it steal some of her warmth. The baby felt like an ice cube that had gotten hypothermia. She was surprised that it had lasted this long. She wondered what the secrets of the baby were and how to find out what the secrets were. So far it seemed like a normal baby. She didn’t know why her enemies wanted the baby. She also didn’t know why she wanted the baby. A sinking thought occurred to her which was not fun to think about. What if the baby was normal like the kids and the people just wanted them for an unknown reason? Her mind drifted back to the task in front of her when she saw a brigade of soldiers blocking the way through the woods. She was confident that they hadn’t seen them, but she wanted to be sure, so she called the kids over to a densely populated area in the forest. She explained to them what she had seen and most of them had seen it. They laid low for a couple hours as the brigade marched by and then she and the kids began walking again. They finally made it to her friend’s house and they were all tired. She collapsed onto her friend’s couch as he showed the kids toward an area where they could sleep. She and her friend started talking about her trip then her words were slurred and she fell asleep. When she woke up her friend told her that she slept for three whole days. She said “I was just tired I guess.” Her friend said “Must have been some trip!” She ate breakfast and went to check on the kids. They told her that they had been trying to get her friend to let them see her, but he wouldn’t let them. They told her that they never wanted to leave because they had never been treated this well in their life. She remembered the baby. She asked her friend if he had taken care of the baby and he said “What baby? Just joking. I found the baby when I was unzipping your jacket when you were asleep.” She asked where the baby was and where her jacket was. Her jacket was on the coat hanger and the baby was in the room with the kids.She was relieved when she realized that the baby was in the room with the kids. She left the room to get a glass of water. After she got her glass of water she went back to the room with the kids. She felt her mouth drop open with amazement as she saw a chair floating in the air. She tried to tell herself that she was seeing things but couldn’t because everyone else was amazed too. She asked who was making the chair float but everyone responded that they weren’t the ones doing it. That left her to wonder if the baby had been the one who had pulled off this amazing feat. It seemed as if everyone else was thinking along the same lines wowed at what they had seen. She knew deep down that this was not an ordinary baby. This baby was something special. They had a quiet dinner with the kids murmuring amongst themselves but not speaking at an audible volume. Everyone it seemed was as perplexed as her about what had happened. She just wanted to go to bed and not think about it. Her brain was tired of thinking about hard things and she wanted to relax. After dinner the kids went to their room and she and her friend pondered about the chair feat. She went to bed late but couldn’t seem to sleep. She kept thinking about her family. She felt a pang of guilt as she thought about how she had abandoned her family. For all she knew they could be missing. She didn’t want to keep thinking about that but it kept haunting her. She just wanted sleep. She eventually drifted into a light sleep. In her dreams, her parents were screaming as she was pulled away from them. She slept undisturbed until dawn. She then read until everyone else was up.While they ate breakfast they discussed what happened. The conclusion they reached was that it was unexplainable. They ate waffles and drank orange juice. She really enjoyed the breakfast that day. She had a conviction that waffles were the best way to start your day. She relaxed that day not doing much except watching tv and snacking on popcorn. The next day she planned to try to find the kids parents. She didn’t feel like it but she had to. She got up the next day with a feeling of readiness for the day before her. She called some people but had no luck.

	 <h2>This is one of my newer stories that I haven't named.</h2>
  <p>He woke to a start. It was time to hide. The police were already at his sister’s room searching for the family. He pulled up the carpet under his bed and got into his hiding place. He felt bad for leaving his family behind but the guilt was better than being taken to jail. He waited until the police left then got out. He looked out for his neighbors but they had been taken to jail too. The new leader was leading everyone in the wrong direction in his opinion. They were arresting innocent families without proof of crimes. His family happened to have a bad reputation but that didn’t mean that the police could come and arrest them. Sooner or later they would come for him, which meant that he would have to hide. He packed a change of clothes and some money and left his house for the bus station. He pulled on a hoodie and pulled the strings tight so that he would blend in. He paid the fare for the bus and took the bus for whatever was farthest from there. The bus ride was a long boring ride because he didn’t think to bring entertainment. He got off the bus several hours later and ran to the nearest forest area. He laid down on the grass and fell asleep. He awoke to a jolt. He was riding in a truck and had been bound by ropes. He couldn’t scream out for help because they had stuffed something in his mouth. He thought that his fate may be worse than his family. He couldn’t make out who was driving. It was still dark outside and it was very cold in the truck. They took him to a dark and cold facility. Whoever these people were, they told him that he was a test subject for an experiment for cryopreservation. They put him in a cell with some other kids his age. No one said anything for awhile until he decided to start some conversation. He asked the kids what cryopreservation was. He pulled out his phone and looked up cryopreservation. The headlines read cryopreservation almost has a breakthrough but trials kill patients! He stopped reading after that. He looked at a picture of his family and wondered where they were. He wanted to find them so badly. He noticed that there was a vent above the cell. He climbed up to the vent and climbed in. He crawled through the tubing until he hit a corridor. He dropped down as silently as he could. He hoped no one would find him.    </p>
  
  <h2>This story has not been titled either. I haven't bothered to do anything with it recently. </h2>
  <p> The loud screams echoed through the house. Her parents were fighting as usual. They were going to get a divorce, and she wished it would go faster. She didn’t want to stay with either of them. She wished someone would care about her for a change. She walked out of the house, looking at the landscape. They lush green grass complemented the bright blue sky. A slight lonely breeze blew. She wished she could at least find a friend before christmas. They lived in Australia, so christmas was always green and bright. She walked to a clearing, and she laid down in the warm dry grass. She loved picking out the shapes in the clouds. She got thinking, and she mused maybe she could run away before christmas. She would find a friend by then, and she would never return to her family and her house. She was so deep in thought that she didn’t realize when a group came up behind her. They came up to her with handfuls of rocks, and by the time she realized what they were doing, she was up on her feet and running. She got a few good hits to the head, but she would recover. She was glad she got away fast enough to escape. She knew they would be back, so she hid herself in a circle of bushes. </p>
